"""
@author: Pike Amornchat, Nicholas Kwok
This thread takes care of all the UART inputs - whether by bluetooth or serial, it will go into a COM port.
The thread reads and decodes the data coming from the MCU into a fully readable string of length 86 (for G
identifiers).

It also deals with connecting to port and provides a method to change port during the execution of the program.
